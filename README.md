# Peakstep's Mysterious Enchantments

This mod adds some unique and interesting enchantments. Each enchantment is balanced to be not too OP but also not too useless.

Currently it features:
* **Rockcrash**, an enchantment applied on boots that damages nearby entities and breaks blocks after falling from a height of more than 6 blocks.
* **Pre-Sharpening**, an enchantment applied on swords that deals higher damage while disallowing weak attack.
* **Crystal Wings**, an extremely rare enchantment applied on chestplates that makes chestplates behave like elytras. They can only be found in end city with a low chance.
* **Perfect Tinkering**, a powerful enchantment applied on swords that reduces the base damage of the weapon but deals extra damage on mobs based on durability and mining level. The lower the durability is / the higher the mining level is, the higher the damage is dealt.

This mod is still in development, and bugs may exist, so please remember to report them in the issue page!
